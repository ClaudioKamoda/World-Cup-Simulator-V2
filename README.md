# World Cup Simulator

2022 is FIFA world Cup year. As a big fan of soccer I decided to build this project to help me play with the possible results.

The **_first phase_** is to have a functional prototype with the current edition of the world cup.

The **_second phase_** is to have a world cup draw simulator as a tab in the application.

The **_third phase_** is to update the app because the format of the competiton is changing after the 2022 edition.

The project will use React.Js and Sass with Redux in the future.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
